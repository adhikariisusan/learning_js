//ecma script and modern javascript AND the concept of transpilers and pollyfills 
// implementing es module in json package files ... to be continued
// es6 provides clean and more expressive code, makes development efficient 
//hoisting in js, is declaring a variable/ function within its scope during the start, no matter in which order the var has been declared/defined. but duting hoisiting, the var is only declared and not defined 
//so to avoid this, we use let and const instead of var 
//IIFE immedeatly invoked function expression, where function identifier is not declared 
/* (function ()
{
    console.log("example of IIFE ")
})
*/

// function prototyping has been substituted by use of class, both of them perform the same thing 
// in a functional paradygm


// function Person(name, place, address, gender)
// {
//     this.name=name;
//     this.place=place;
//     this.gender=gender;
//     this.address=address;
// }

//Person.prototype.

// let name = "yogesh"
// let age = 22;
// console.log(name+22);
// console.log(`Pratap`);
// console.log(typeof`pratap`); //which will be string 
// console.log(`${name} and the age is ${age}`);

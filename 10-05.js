// introduction to web api and asynchronous usage 
//WEB apis example are DOM, XMLHTTP request etc, these things are pre built 
// event listenrs, callbacks promises and async and await (promises are used for aunchronous fetching 

// event loop where call stack sends the inst to web ai which then sends to queue which then is in queue 
//but event loop always looks for completion of call stack untill it can address queue which means that all the synchronous data will be executed and then 
//queue will be addressed where asynchronous commands are present
